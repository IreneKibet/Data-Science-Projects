**Salary Prediction Project**

This project aims to predict employee salaries based on various factors such as years of experience, job title, and education level. The analysis used a comprehensive dataset and multiple machine-learning models for accurate predictions.

**Key Features**:

 - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted an in-depth dataset analysis to understand the factors influencing employee salaries. The EDA revealed that years of experience, job title, and education level are significant predictors of salary.

 - **Data Visualization**: Utilized various plots such as boxplots, violin plots, and scatter plots to visualize the relationships between salary and other variables. These visualizations helped in identifying trends and patterns in the data.

 - **Machine Learning Models**: Implemented and evaluated different regression models including Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor. The Random Forest Regressor outperformed other models, achieving an accuracy of 94.6%.

 - **Model Evaluation**: Used metrics such as R2 Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate the performance of the models.

**Conclusion**:

The project demonstrates that employees with more years of experience, advanced job titles like Data Analyst/Scientist, Software Developer, or Director/Manager/VP, and higher education levels (Master's or Doctoral degrees) tend to have higher salaries. The Random Forest Regressor was identified as the best-performing model for salary prediction, providing accurate and reliable results.
